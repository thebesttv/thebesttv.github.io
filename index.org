There is another form of context sensitivity
- based on equality constraints: assignment =x = y= is modeled with
  constraint $pt(y) = pt(x)$ instead of $pt(y) \subseteq pt(x)$

While this approach has been shown to scale for C++ programs, we are
unaware of a scalable implementation for Java-like languages. In
particular, the increased use of virtual dispatch in Java negatively
affects the scalability of the equality-based approach.
